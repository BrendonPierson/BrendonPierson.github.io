    <h4>I am a full stack software developer interested in all things Web.</h4>

       <span class="firstLetter">B</span><strong>ackground</strong>: I first got into coding while teaching high school science at a Nashville public school.  With 160+ students, grading would take me an hour a day, if I stayed on top of it.  I started to streamline the process with excel macros and direct upload to the school gradebook.  I continuously refined my process over the course of the year until I was scanning in scores using <a href="https://www.masteryconnect.com/">Mastery Connect</a>, then made a python web scraping script to grab the scores for all students, generate an analysis report, and save them in the propper format to upload to the gradebook. 
     </p>

       Time spent grading went from over an hour down to five minutes, and I was hooked on programming.  I was lucky enough to attend the Nashville Software School six month intensive boot camp.  There I learned the tools and techniques of modern full-stack web development.

       In my spare time I enjoy tinkering with RaspberryPis, arduinos, and cameras.  Whenever I can I am rock climbing outside, hopefully in a cool place with cool people.
